Hi all,

The executive team is sponsoring a new competition aimed at building new AI demos that can be used across the company.

Here are the details:

Create a 5-10 minute demo using MariaDB Cloud for an AI use case. You will need to use MariaDB's vector search capabilities in this demo. Bonus points will be given if you use MCP Server, MariaDB Cloud co-pilots and/or AI framework integrations. We are looking for cool AI use cases that will get people thinking about the endless possibilities that MariaDB can power. Demos may be used on our website, social channels, YouTube, and with customers/prospects.
Judges: Jags, Alejandro, Tina, Kester, Kathy, Ricardo will review all demos and select the top 3.
The top 3 winners will get to present at Sales Kickoff (SKO) in Barcelona on Feb 4. If you are not already going to SKO, you will get a ticket to attend.
SKO attendees will vote on the spot to award the prizes.
3rd place: $2k
2nd place: $3k
1st place: $20k

Timeline: Submit your demo by Friday, January 9. Judges will make their picks by Wednesday, January 14 for the top 3.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Good luck and we can't wait to see what you come up with!
