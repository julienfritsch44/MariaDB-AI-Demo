{"query_id":4,"suggestion_type":"AI_OPTIMIZATION","suggestion_text":"The slow query `explain select * from t1 where pk1=?` indicates a simple primary key lookup, but it's slow.  Given the limited context, the most likely cause and optimization involves table statistics.\n\n**Suggestion:**\n\nUpdate table statistics for `t1`.  This allows the optimizer to accurately estimate costs, even for primary key lookups, and choose the best execution plan.\n\n```sql\nANALYZE TABLE t1;\n```\n\n*   **Risk Level:** Low\n*   **Estimated Gain:** High (If statistics are outdated or missing, this can significantly improve performance. If statistics are up-to-date, the gain will be negligible.)\n","sql_fix":null,"confidence":0.85,"sources":["jira:MDEV-37723","jira:MDEV-37422","jira:MDEV-37774"]}
